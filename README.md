## How to run/install
This project requires the latest version of MLton compiler.
For this reason a `start.sh` was provided and launches a docker container that is pre-configured with the compiler

If you want to save the changes made in the docker container:

```
# Verify the folder that needs to be copied in the docker container
docker> pwd

# Enter the project root directory in the host machine
$> cd proj-root-dir

# List docker container-IDs
$> docker ps

# Copy the entire folder from the docker container
$> docker cp <container-ID>:/root/Development/sdh-algs/dot-product-sparse . 
```
